# JavaScript
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. 
It is also known as scripting language for web pages. It can be used for Client-side as well as Server-side developments. 
It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

## Features of JavaScript
* All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
* JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
* JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
* JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
* It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
* It is a case-sensitive language.
* JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
* It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.

## Adding JavaScript into the Web Page
JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:

* Internal JavaScript: We can add JavaScript code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the <script> tag. The <script> tag can either be placed inside the <head> or the <body> tag according to the requirement.
```c
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 
<head>
    <title>
        Basic Example to Describe JavaScript
    </title>
</head>
 
<body>
 
    <!-- JavaScript code can be embedded inside
        head section or body section -->
    <script>
        console.log("Welcome to JavaScript");
    </script>
</body>
 
</html>
```
* External JavaScript File: We can create a file with .js extension and paste the JavaScript code inside it. After creating the file, add this file in <script src=”file_name.js”> tag inside <head> tag of the HTML file.
  
## JavaScript Engine
  A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.
